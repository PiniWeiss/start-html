      The rise of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) from a fringe group to the ruling power
      in Germany is one of the most significant transformations in modern
      history. Its ascent was fueled by a combination of economic despair,
      political instability, and the charismatic, yet manipulative, leadership
      of Adolf Hitler. In the aftermath of World War I, Germany was reeling from
      a humiliating defeat and the harsh conditions of the Treaty of Versailles.
      The nascent Weimar Republic faced hyperinflation and social unrest,
      creating a vacuum for extremist ideologies. Hitler joined the German
      Workers' Party in 1919, quickly renaming it the National Socialist German
      Workers' Party and utilizing his oratory skills to capitalize on public
      grievances. He promoted a platform of ultra-nationalism, anti-Semitism,
      and the "Stab-in-the-back" myth, which blamed Jews and socialists for
      Germany's loss in the war. The turning point came with the Great
      Depression in 1929. As unemployment skyrocketed and the middle class
      collapsed, the Nazis' promises of "Work and Bread" resonated with a
      desperate electorate. Between 1928 and 1932, the party's share of the vote
      surged from under 3% to 37%. The Nazis also utilized sophisticated
      propaganda led by Joseph Goebbels and paramilitary violence via the SA
      (Brownshirts) to intimidate opponents. In January 1933, conservative
      politicians, believing they could "tame" Hitler, convinced President
      Hindenburg to appoint him Chancellor. Once in power, the Nazis exploited
      the Reichstag Fire to suspend civil liberties and passed the Enabling Act,
      effectively establishing a totalitarian dictatorship and ending German
      democracy."
