      Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) was the leader of the Nazi Party and the dictator
      of Germany from 1933 until his death. Born in Austria, he rose to power by
      exploiting economic distress and nationalistic resentment following World
      War I. His regime, the Third Reich, was characterized by totalitarian
      control, aggressive expansionism, and extreme racial ideology. Hitlers
      central belief was the superiority of the "Aryan race" and the perceived
      threat of "inferior" groups, primarily Jews. This ideology led to the
      Holocaust, the systematic, state-sponsored genocide of six million Jews
      and millions of others, including Romani people, individuals with
      disabilities, and political dissidents. His invasion of Poland in 1939
      triggered World War II, the deadliest conflict in human history. Under his
      leadership, Germany transformed into a war machine, but his strategic
      failures and the combined strength of the Allied forces eventually led to
      Germany's defeat. As Soviet forces closed in on Berlin in April 1945,
      Hitler committed suicide in his underground bunker. His legacy remains one
      of the darkest chapters in history, serving as a universal warning against
      the dangers of hatred, propaganda, and unchecked absolute power. The
      atrocities committed under his rule shaped modern international law and
      human rights standards.
